        "description": "Three consecutive tears in the same calf made Nacho Scocco think about throwing soccer. The injury would not leave him alone and the last months of 2018 and the first months of 2019 were very complicated for the 34-year-old striker who had to almost completely change his diet to be able to continue playing for River.It was the same injury that was not finished healing. At a time when I could not find the way back it crossed my mind to throw everything away, Scocco said in an interview with the newspaper Olé, although he later found answers by traveling to Spain to see a doctor and a nutritionist specializing in muscle injuries. The trip to Spain was my last gasp to find a solution. They accommodated me a lot in terms of nutrition and now I really feel great, said Nacho, who will turn 35 in May.Among the things that the striker can no longer eat are sweets, wheat flour and dairy products, he said. He also revealed that now I have to eat a lot of food for celiacs, many things sweetened with stevia and then, instead of dairy products, now I eat goat cheese. River's soccer player assures that he feels important changes since he modified his diet: I feel a difference in terms of physique and recovery from one training session to another. An improvement. Especially in the preseason, which was short and demanding. Post-game recovery is also better",
